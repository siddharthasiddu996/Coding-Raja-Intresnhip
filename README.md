### Task given : Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

For this task, we performed sentiment analysis on social media data using the Sentiment140 dataset. The dataset contains a collection of tweets with pre-labeled sentiments. The main steps involved in this task were:

The Dataset consists of around 1.6 Million tweets . I have worked on to preprocess the dataset and to remove the duplicates from it.

1. *Data Preprocessing*: 
    - Cleaning the text data by removing special characters, numbers, and unnecessary whitespaces.
    - Tokenizing the text and converting it into a format suitable for machine learning models.
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. *Model Building*:
    - Using Machine Learning Algorithms I have trained a model for sentiment classification.
    - Experimenting with various architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

3. *Evaluation*:
    - Assessing the model's accuracy and other performance metrics on the test dataset.
    - Visualizing the results to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

4. *Deployment*:
   - I have created an simple web interface . So that everyone can access it  through the web application.
   - To run the web application after unwrapping the zip file you have downloaded
  
   - I have create an interface using streamlit librray. To access that interface I have created an streamlit_app.py file .
   - In this file I have written my code.
   - Streamlit is an python library which will help the people to develop an simple web interface using the python.
   - To run the file open command prompt and type "streamlit run streamlit_app.py"
     **Note** : If you have not installed streamlit library in your desktop run command "pip install streamlit".
